Some filler text to trigger the bug.

This is the contents of the post below the separation:

```yaml
An entity[^blog] with a footnote[^footnote]

[^blog]: AKA Blog Post, but let's at least give it some heft.
[^footnote]: As "promised"[^kinda]
[^kinda]: Only kinda[^said] promised, I know, but still
[^said]: Well, "as I said" at least...
```
